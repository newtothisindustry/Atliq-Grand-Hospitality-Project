# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis - PowerBI

## Summary
This project was pursued and completed as a part of the course-'Python for Beginners and Intermediate Learners. It focuses on using the Pandas library in Python to analyze datasets and generate insights on the performance of the Atliq Grand hotel chain. Following this, it also includes the visualization of the insights generated using a dashboard built in PowerBI. 

## Problem statement
Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
